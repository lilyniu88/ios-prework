## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Applications:
1) Beli-game polls against other restaurants to find your favorite, curates rating for your based on answers
2) Tiktok-sending videos to friends, can save drafts of videos made
3) Spotify-can customize pictures and names of playlists, can join jams with friends

An app I'd like to build is based off of Spotify and can be used to analyze your music taste. It's kind of like Spotify wrapped but it's something you can see at any time. It'll track your most played playlists, songs, and artists and analyze your compatibility of music taste with your friends.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My computer is a little too slow at running the app so I can't see if it implemented the button correctly but I followed all the instructions
